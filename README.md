Note: Please attempt the question (listed below), you are assigned to (6 questions). Every question has the different purpose and also avoids any “assignment sharing issues” between the team members. Each attender has to submit the assignment before the class starts (very strictly- be responsible-No exception). You can send the assignment on prabhat.kiran.tiwari@gmail.com or can share me the google drive path from where I can be able to fetch the submitted assignment. Please send two files-

# Questions:

1.	Write a Java application to print all the numbers from 300 to 200 (Note: not 200 to 300).
2.	Construct an array of even numbers that lies between 50 and 100.
3.	Construct an array of odd numbers that lies between 20 and 80.
4.	Write a Java application to find the sum of the numbers between 1 to 120.
5.	Write a Java application to find the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 50.
6.	Write a Java application to find the sum of all odd numbers from 100 to 200.
7.	Construct an array of integers for 2,5,7,9,23,44,65,78,123,433,992. Use the for loop to iterate through all the elements inside the to find the even and odd numbers in this array. The program should print all the even numbers and odd numbers in the console. For example, the message should be like this: “The even numbers in the given array are: xx,yy,zz”. In the same way, odd numbers should also be printed.
8.	Create an array of name of days in a week and print only the days that start with the letter “T”. (Look out of the boundary, not just class content- means- “google it because it might be a little more than what we studied so far in class but is easy”).
